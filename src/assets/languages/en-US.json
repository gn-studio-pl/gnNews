In fact, I ran into some errors every now and then, but as a result everything works. At first I had trouble finding my way around using styled components.

And by the way, I found out that it is a very simple matter :) Also, one of the greatest satisfactions gave me the development of lazy loading for loading the list of articles. Nothing like a successful UX :)",
